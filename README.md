Journal App Api

Concept: A digital notebook/bullet journal where a user can write posts on a variety of topics.
The user can write posts on any topic and they show up in reverse chronological order on their
main page. The titles and dates of posts are listed in a clickable sidebar. Additionally, a user can
attach one or multiple ‘threads’ to a post, which act as filters for related topics. When a user 
selects a given thread from the sidebar, all posts from that thread will display in the main page.

I plan to use Rails/Postgres for the back and and React/Javascript for the front end.

In the second version of the website I plan to add the ability to upload photos using Amazon Web Services.

A user can…
* log in/out
* use the website on a computer or a phone
* create a name for the journal
* write a post
* read their own past posts
* title a post
* see the date a post was created
* edit a post (new date displays?)
* delete a post
* see all posts’ titles in the index in reverse chronological order
* select a post to view from the index
* mark a post as part of a thread(s)
* select a thread to display all posts in that thread
* create custom threads

Version 2
A user can…
* attach an image to a post
